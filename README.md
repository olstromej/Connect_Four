#Connect Four

Connect four is a game that has two players. The two players main objective is to align four of their own checkers in a row, anywhere on the board. Each player has their own color checkers. In this game player one has a red checker and player two has a purple checker.

After doing research I found that their are over 4,531,985,219,092 positions available on the connect four board.
